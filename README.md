Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a client that wants to develop an online presence for their driving school. The system is a web based educational platform that also integrates a scheduling system for in person classes.

What did you do particularly well?
I explained high level concepts to laypeople well.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would spend more time on both documents to do a more thorough job detailing and developing the system. I would add more depth and clarity to the design document.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I listened to the requirements outlined in the user stories. Interpreting the user's needs is an imperative step in development. The user provides the best information about the requirements for the project and how they can be most useful.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I pay close attention to the requirements of the project and make a thorough plan for how I will implement features. I will definitely use the listening and analysis techniques that I learned in this course to improve my skills in the future.
